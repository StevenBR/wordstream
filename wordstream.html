		</h1>
		<p><strong>PPC</strong> (<a>pay-per click</a>) search marketing software offers a means for accomplishing two core requirements for PPC optimization:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>PPC Automation</strong> - While it would be impossibile (and inadvisable!) to automate every aspect of pay-per-click advertising automating away redundant, time-consuming tasks affords you a means of increasing productivity. Often, this means being able to produce an amount of work that would otherwise have been unachievable for you and your business.

			<li><strong>PPC Management</strong> - <a>PPC management</a> refers to the maintenance and prioritization of <a>paid search</a> marketing tasks.
